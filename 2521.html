  <h2>Synopsis</h2>
  <p>In a time when dreams seem out of reach, a teen fencer pursues big ambitions and meets a hardworking young man who seeks to rebuild his life. At ages 22 and 18, they said each other's names for the first time; and at ages 25 and 21, they fell in love. </p>
  <p>Na Hee-do (Kim Tae-ri) is a member of the school fencing team at Seonjung Girls' High School, but due to the IMF crisis, the team is disbanded.

Baek Yi-jin’s (Nam Joo-hyuk) family goes from “riches to rags” and are separated due to the financial crisis. He is forced to take up several part-time jobs and later becomes a sports reporter.</p>
  <p>In the present day, Kim Min-chae (Choi Myung-bin), Na Hee-do's daughter, quits ballet and "runs away" to her grandma's house. During her stay, she comes across her mother's diary, which the story is then told through.</p>
